- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With a lot of struggle, improved my knowledge about Positions, relative and absolute, after pseudo-elements and background position. Also the bottom section of the page, with the gradient progress bar, was required a lot o thought to make it work.

```html
<section class="blue-bg storage-usage">
      <p>Youâ€™ve used <span class="bold-txt">815 GB</span> of your storage</p>
      <div class="progress-container">
        <div class="container-bar">
          <div class="gradient">
            <div class="marker"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="progress-label">
          <p>0 GB</p>
          <p>1000 GB</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
```
```css
.balon::after {

        content: "";
    
        width: 0;
        height: 0;
    
        position: absolute;
    
        border-left: 20px solid transparent;
    
        border-top: 20px solid #fff;
    
        bottom: -20px;
        left: 136.109px;
    }
```

### Continued development

I'll keep look for even more better and cleaner ways to make the balon and his triangle.
